[00:00.38] Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[00:04.33] Ooh-ooh-ooh
[00:07.68] Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[00:17.87] I could say I never dare
[00:19.59] To think about you in that way
[00:22.02] But, I would be lying
[00:26.46] And I pretend I’m happy for you
[00:28.39] When you find some dude to take home
[00:31.84] But, I won’t deny that
[00:34.25] In the midst of the crowds
[00:37.03] In the shapes in the clouds
[00:39.01] I don’t see nobody but you
[00:43.49] In my rose-tinted dreams
[00:45.66] Wrinkled silk on my sheets
[00:47.83] I don’t see nobody but you
[00:52.77] Boy, you got me hooked on to something
[00:55.00] Who could say that they saw us coming?
[00:57.16] Tell me, do you feel the love?
[01:01.67] Spend the summer of a lifetime with me
[01:03.82] Let me take you to the place of your dreams
[01:06.03] Tell me, do you feel the love?
[01:10.50] Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[01:19.53] And I could say I never answered
[01:21.60] Those believers inside my head
[01:24.84] But that’s far from the truth
[01:27.24] Don’t know what’s come over me
[01:30.14] It seems like yesterday when I said
[01:33.12] “We’ll be friends forever”
[01:36.60] Constellations of stars
[01:38.52] Murals on city walls
[01:40.83] I don’t see nobody but you
[01:45.50] You’re my vice, you’re my muse
[01:47.38] You’re a nineteenth floor view
[01:49.49] I don’t see nobody but you
[01:54.48] Boy, you got me hooked on to something
[01:56.61] Who could say that they saw us coming?
[01:58.75] Tell me, do you feel the love?
[02:03.36] Spend the summer of a lifetime with me
[02:05.45] Let me take you to the place of your dreams
[02:07.90] Tell me, do you feel the love?
[02:12.00] Boy, you got me hooked on to something
[02:14.30] Who could say that they saw us coming?
[02:16.27] Tell me, do you feel the love?
[02:20.88] Spend the summer of a lifetime with me
[02:22.87] Let me take you to the place of your dreams
[02:25.52] Tell me, do you feel the love?
[02:26.86] Do you feel the love? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[02:31.09] Do you feel the love?
[02:32.65] Do you feel the love?
[02:37.63] Do you feel the love?
[02:41.80] Feel the love
[02:47.01] Feel the love
